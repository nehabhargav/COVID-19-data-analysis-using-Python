# COVID-19-data-analysis-using-Python


As a data analyst we are always faced with a problem to solve and answer some questions. The main work is to work with different data sources. This project is also related to the question and the answer that we are going to find.
Is there any relationship between the spread of coronavirus in a country and how happy people are living  in that country ?

In order to answer the question.  
we worked with 2 data sets.  
The first one is Covid-19 dataset published by John Hopkins university. Which consist of data related to cumulative number of confirmed cases in different countries per day.
The second dataset is related to world happiness report. The world happiness report is on annual publication of the UN.
we merged this two dataset and calculated the measure which helped us to find the answer.
Result :
We found that there are positive correlation between the maximum infection rates. 
With all the life factors that we have in our dataset.
We found very interesting results in our data set. 
That is people who are living in developed countries are more prone to infections from corona . As compared to people in less developed countries.
Then you might say that this is because of lack of test kits in less developed countries so in order to prove that this is not the case .
I recommend you to the exact same analysis on the data set related to cumulative number of deaths


Here are some of the  outputs of my analysis:
